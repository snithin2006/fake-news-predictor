# Fake News Visualizer

A web application to visualize and analyze fake news detection results, built with React for the frontend and Python (Flask/Django) for the backend. The project aims to provide real-time insights into fake news data using machine learning models and allow users to interact with the data through an intuitive interface.

## Project Overview
This project is designed to identify and visualize fake news in various formats (text, articles, etc.) using machine learning techniques. The backend implements an AI/ML model to classify news articles, while the frontend provides an interactive dashboard to view the results. This project demonstrates how to combine machine learning, web development, and data visualization for impactful societal change.

### Features
- Real-time fake news detection
- Interactive dashboard displaying categorized news data
- User-friendly interface with visualizations of detection accuracy and trends
- Backend integration for processing and updating news data

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: 
  - React.js
  - React-Router for routing
  - Chart.js or D3.js for visualizations
  - Axios for making API requests

- **Backend**: 
  - Flask/Django (depends on your setup)
  - Machine Learning model for fake news detection (e.g., TensorFlow, scikit-learn)
  - Python (for backend APIs and model interaction)
